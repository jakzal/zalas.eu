I'm writing this blog post while listening to the first song I bought just few minutes ago on **Ubuntu One Music Store**. It cost me **79** euro **cents**. Oh yes, [Ubuntu One Music Store is public now](http://voices.canonical.com/ubuntuone/?p=263)!

**Ubuntu One Music Store** is a part of Ubuntu One cloud services. As it's integrated with **Rhythmbox**, Ubuntu's default music player, your favorite songs are just a few clicks away.

It is so simple and easy. I'm really impressed.
