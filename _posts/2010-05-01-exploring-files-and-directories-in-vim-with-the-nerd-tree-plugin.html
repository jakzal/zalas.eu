Exploring, opening, switching, renaming, moving files and directories are common tasks performed during coding. In IDEs it is usually achieved with some kind of filesystem explorer. In vim I preffer to use the <a title="NERD tree plugin for vim" href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658">NERD tree plugin</a>.

<h2>NERD Tree features</h2>
<strong>NERD tree</strong> enables you to:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Navigate</strong> and <strong>jump</strong> through the directory tree</li>
	<li><strong>Open</strong> files in the current window, tab, split view (horizontal and vertical)</li>
	<li><strong>Change</strong> the current working directory</li>
	<li><strong>Add</strong>, <strong>move</strong>, <strong>copy</strong> and <strong>remove</strong> files and directories</li>
	<li><strong>Filter</strong> the tree</li>
	<li><strong>Create the bookmarks</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
Get the source from <a title="NERD tree plugin for vim" href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658">the plugin website</a> and unzip it into your <em>~/.vim</em> directory.

To make   using <strong>NERD tree</strong> more convenient it's best to create a shortcut mapping. To use ctrl+n add the following line to your <em>~/.vimrc</em> file:
<pre>nmap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;c-n&gt; :NERDTreeToggle&lt;CR&gt;</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
Run vim and type <em>:NERDTreeToggle</em> or <em>ctrl+n</em>. The later will work only if you've created a   mapping. <strong>NERD tree</strong> should open and present you the directory structure.

I'd suggest you to start with pressing theÂ <em>?</em> to read a quick help and learn about the plugin features.
