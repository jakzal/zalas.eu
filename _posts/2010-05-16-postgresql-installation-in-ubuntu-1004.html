  description: PostgreSQL is a powerful and reliable object-relational database system.
    It's a great alternative for MySQL. It is as easy to set up, performs better and
    offers far more features.

It's a great alternative for MySQL. It is as easy to set up, performs better and offers far more features.

To install PostgreSQL server run:
<pre>sudo aptitude install postgresql</pre>
Database users can be created in command line with <em>createuser</em> tool.        Running the following command will create user 'kuba' who is not a superuser, can  create databases, cannot create new roles and his password is stored encrypted. You will be asked to give new user's password as '-P' option is passed.
<pre>sudo su postgres -c 'createuser -S -d -R -E -P kuba'</pre>
<strong>Note</strong>: Run <em>createuser</em> with <em>--help</em> switch to get an overview of available options.

There is a similar tool for database creation called createdb:
<pre>createdb mydatabase</pre>
