Today, 28th of July 2011, <a title="Symfony 2.0" href="http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-2-0">Symfony 2 was announced stable</a>. We've been waiting long but it was worth it!
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839" title="Symfony2 and PHP" src="/uploads/wp/2011/07/symfonylab-header.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<a title="Symfony2 community is pushing PHP ecosystem" href="http://pooteeweet.org/blog/0/1915">Symfony community is pushing the PHP ecosystem</a> for quite some time already. It sets the trends and standards not only by developing the framework but also by providing many <strong>high quality tools</strong> which can be used without it (like Behat, Assetic, Twig). Also, the whole idea of decoupled components brings <strong>a new quality</strong> to the <strong>PHP</strong> world.

Stable release of Symfony2 marks the begining of<a title="The new era of PHP frameworks" href="http://blog.webspecies.co.uk/2011-05-23/the-new-era-of-php-frameworks.html"> a new era of PHP frameworks</a>.

Personally, at the beginning of 2007 I was about to abandon PHP and move to something else. Release of symfony 1.0 made me stay for quite long.

Today Symfony2 <strong>brings the faith in PHP back</strong> again. Thanks to all of <a title="Symfony2 Contributors" href="http://symfony.com/contributors">the contributors</a>!
