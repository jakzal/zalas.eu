![](/uploads/wp/2011/04/nginx-symfony.png)Recent release of Nginx 1.0.0 triggered me to refresh my knowledge about its configuration options. There were quite some additions since I looked in the docs for the last time. New variables and directives let me to simplify my configuration for Symfony projects (both 1.x and 2).

**Warning:** Configurations published on the Internet usually suffer from the vulnerability which allows to run a non-PHP file as a PHP. More about the problem here: "[Setting up PHP-FastCGI and nginx? Donâ€™t trust the tutorials: check your configuration!](https://nealpoole.com/blog/2011/04/setting-up-php-fastcgi-and-nginx-dont-trust-the-tutorials-check-your-configuration/)". For Nginx+PHP installation read "[Setting up a PHP development environment with Nginx on Ubuntu 11.04](http://www.zalas.eu/setting-up-a-php-development-environment-with-nginx-on-ubuntu-1104)".


## Configuration


The convention says we should put virtual host configurations into _/etc/nginx/sites-available/_ directory and then link to them in _/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/_.

Rules below define development virtual hosts. We'll put them into _/etc/nginx/sites-available/dev_ file.

    
    server {
        listen 80 default;
        server_name *.dev;
    
        root /var/www/$host/current/web;
    
        access_log /var/log/nginx/$host-access.log;
        error_log  /var/log/nginx/dev-error.log error;
    
        index app.php index.html index.htm;
    
        try_files $uri $uri/ @rewrite;
    
        location @rewrite {
            rewrite ^/(.*)$ /app.php/$1;
        }   
    
        location ~ \.php {
            # try_files $uri =404;
    
            fastcgi_index app.php;
            fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
    
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
            fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
            fastcgi_param PATH_TRANSLATED $document_root$fastcgi_path_info;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
    
        location ~ /\.ht {
            deny all;
        }
    }


Don't forget about the symbolic link (_/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/dev_).


## More about the configuration



    
        listen 80 default;


Nginx listens on the port 80 by default. What's important in this line is the second parameter - "default". It makes that Nginx treats given host as a default one.

    
        server_name *.dev;


Our dynamic virtual host will accept every _.dev_ domain (_kuba.dev_, _myproject.dev_ etc).

Alternatively we could simply list one ore more domains (i.e. _server_name zalas.eu_). In such case we'd probably define every domain in a separate _server {}_ section.

    
        root /var/www/$host/current/web;


Root directory will be defined dynamically based on the _$host_ variable (_/var/www/kuba.dev/current/web_ for _kuba.dev_ domain).

    
        access_log /var/log/nginx/$host-access.log;
        error_log  /var/log/nginx/dev-error.log error;


Every domain will have its own access log. Unfortunately we cannot use _$host_ variable with error logs. Therefore all the errors will be logged into the same file.

    
        index app.php index.html index.htm;


Index files are checked every time URL points to the directory. Nginx will try them one by one until it finds an existing one.

_app.php_ is a default controller in Symfony2. For symfony 1.x it's usually _index.php_.

    
        try_files $uri $uri/ @rewrite;


It's a really elegant solution for readable URLs as it lets us to [avoid evil if statements](http://wiki.nginx.org/IfIsEvil).

During the request Nginx will check for an existence of a file first. If the file doesn't exist it will look for a directory. If both checks fail it will rewrite the request to the _named location_.

    
        location @rewrite {
            rewrite ^/(.*)$ /app.php/$1;
        }


This named location is reached only if user wasn't requesting an existing file or directory. We want to rewrite such a request to the default controller.

    
        location ~ \.php {
            fastcgi_index app.php;
            fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
    
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
            fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
            fastcgi_param PATH_TRANSLATED $document_root$fastcgi_path_info;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        }


All the PHP requests will be routed to the fastcgi deamon (running locally on port 9000).

Appart from including default fastcgi parameters we make sure that PATH_INFO and SCRIPT_FILENAME variables are set properly. _fastcgi_split_path_info_ says how to split the controller file from the path.

    
        location ~ /\.ht {
            deny all;
        }


This will forbid access to apache's _.htaccess_ files. These are only simple text files for Nginx and we don't want them to be accessible via the browser.
