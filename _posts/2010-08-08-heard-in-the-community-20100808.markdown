## Doctrine Annotations Library


[Jonathan Wage](http://twitter.com/jwage) wrote on his blog about [Doctrine Annotations Library](http://www.jwage.com/2010/08/02/doctrine-annotations-library/). It's used in Doctrine2 ORM for mapping information specified in doc-blocks.

I'm really excited about it, especially because it is an independent library. It makes it a perfect tool for [meta-programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming). I can't wait to put my hands on it!

Read more about it in [Doctrine2 annotations](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/common/2.0/docs/reference/annotations/en) docs.


## PHP, Community and User Groups


[Cal Evans](http://twitter.com/calevans) published [ideas for building User Groups](http://blog.calevans.com/2010/08/06/php-community-and-user-groups/). He gathered them from PHP User Group leaders. There's also a video from TEKX conference where the topic is discussed with four people who are experienced in building such groups.

## Apostrophe Updates


There's a new version of [Apostrophe](http://www.apostrophenow.com/) CMS (one of the best symfony based Content Management Systems out there). Release announcement is available on [P'unk Avenue Window](http://window.punkave.com/2010/08/06/apostrophe-updates/).


## Should Developers have Access to Production?


Kyle Brandt provoked long discussion whether [developers should have access to production environment](http://blog.serverfault.com/post/893001713/should-developers-have-access-to-production). He did a very good job analyzing the issue and pointing out a few possible solutions.


## phpBB powers symfony


Symfony2 will power phpBB4 but for now [phpBB powers symfony forum](http://twitter.com/fabpot/status/20233054202). All the [old URLs should work like before](http://forum.symfony-project.org/).


## PHP Anthem


[PHP finally has an anthem]( http://shiflett.org/blog/2010/aug/php-anthem). It's not really my preferred music style but it's fun anyway.

Sing along! "_Oh yeah, I'm so PHP this year. Got a mic in the left, and 'n the right, cold beer._"
