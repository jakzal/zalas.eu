<a title="Google Chrome" href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> doesn't support Linux based operating systems yet. However, it is made on <a title="Chromium" href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a> which works on all major platforms. Chromium is an Open Source web browser with the same feature set as Google Chrome. Actually Google Chrome is based on Chromium. The only difference is the logo.

<a title="Chromium daily builds on launchpad" href="https://edge.launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/ppa">Chromium daily builds</a> are available on <a title="Chromium on launchpad" href="https://launchpad.net/chromium-browser">launchpad</a>. Be aware that these builds are automated. That means packages are not tested and may be broken. However, I use these repositories since Ubuntu 9.04 and I hardly have problems with Chromium. As in <strong>Ubuntu 9.10</strong> the installation process became even simpler I encourage you to give it a try.

Since we use Karmic Koala manual edition of <em>/etc/apt/sources.list</em> is no longer needed. Now we are able to add new sources and fetch required GPG keys with one command:
<pre>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chromium-daily</pre>
Than we simply refresh the package database and install Chromium Browser with:
<pre>
sudo aptitude update
sudo aptitude install chromium-browser</pre>
There are no additional steps for flash support anymore. It just works.
