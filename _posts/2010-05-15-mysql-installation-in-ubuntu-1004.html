It's relatively easy to set up and use. Here's a quick guide of how to install and configure MySQL in the newest release of Ubuntu.

First install the MySQL server:
<pre>sudo aptitude install mysql-server</pre>
The installer will ask you for a root password. Using root user, however, is    not the best practice. It's way better to give yourself permissions to create   and use databases.

First open MySQL console:
<pre>mysql -p -u root</pre>
Next, grant yourself all priviledges for localhost connections (replace 'kuba'  with your user name and password with password of your preference):
<pre>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO kuba@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'my$ecret';
\q</pre>
Now you can create MySQL databases without the need of using root account:
<pre>mysqladmin -p create wordpress</pre>
