"Heard in the Community" series aims to wrap up news from the PHP, symfony and other communities I find interesting and follow.

Here's the first post.
<h2>Protect your privates</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-504 alignleft" title="Symfony2" src="/uploads/wp/2010/07/mini_logo.png" alt="Symfony2" width="245" height="61" /><a title="Symfony2 Coding Standards" href="http://symfony-reloaded.org/contributing/Code/Standards">Symfony2 coding standards</a> favor public and protected access modifiers over private. Blog post by Lukas started hot discussion on this subject in the community (on twitter and blogs):
<ul>

	<li><a title="Good use of public, private and protected in OO class design" href="http://www.jansch.nl/2010/07/19/good-use-of-public-private-and-protected-in-oo-class-design/">Good use of public, private and protected in OO class design</a> by <a title="Ivo Jansch" href="http://twitter.com/ijansch">Ivo Jansch</a></li>
</ul>
While I think that all methods should be as private as possible I can understand points made in the listed blog posts. I guess coding an Open Source framework might need different approach. In everyday work, however, I believe it's a good practice to make the <strong>main responsibility of a class public</strong> and its <strong>internals private or protected</strong>.
<h2>PHP4 is dead (again)</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-506 alignleft" title="WordPress" src="/uploads/wp/2010/07/grey-s.png" alt="WordPress" width="50" height="50" /> Over 3 years ago <a title="PHP4 End Of Life" href="http://www.php.net/archive/2007.php#2007-07-13-1">PHP4 end of life announcement</a> was published. Despite its death PHP4 is still hanging around like a zombie. Some of the popular Open Source projects keep supporting it. WordPress is one of the last projects to <a title="PHP4 End of Life Announcement by WordPress" href="http://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/">announce end of support for PHP4</a>. Finally I'd say.
<h2>PHP 5.3.3 Was Released</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-450 alignleft" title="PHP" src="/uploads/wp/2010/05/php-med-trans-light.gif" alt="PHP" width="95" height="51" />Both PHP <strong>5.3.3</strong> and <strong>5.2.14</strong> <a title="PHP 5.3.3 Released" href="http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-07-22-2">were released</a> with many bug and security fixes. I'm really happy to read that <a title="php-fpm" href="http://php-fpm.org/">FPM</a> (FastCGI Process Manager) SAPI is now available in the PHP out of the box.
<h2>An entirely unscientific look at why people attend conferences</h2>
I mainly attend conferences to <strong>network</strong> and find <strong>inspiration</strong>. <a title="Cal Evans on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/calevans">Cal Evans</a> asked group of developers and managers <a title="An entirely unscientific look at why people attend conferences" href="http://blog.calevans.com/2010/07/19/an-entirely-unscientific-look-at-why-people-attend-conferences/">why people attend conferenes</a> and gathered quite an interesting results.
