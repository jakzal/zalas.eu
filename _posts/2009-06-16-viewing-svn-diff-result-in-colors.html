<em>svn diff</em> allows us to see the changes made on the files in the subversion repository. However, its outputÂ  is not always clear. New lines are just marked with '+' and removed ones with '-'.

We can improve our experience a bit by installing <a title="colordiff homepage" href="http://colordiff.sourceforge.net/">colordiff</a>. It wraps <em>diff</em> command and produces the same output but coloured.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/uploads/wp/2009/06/svn-diff-after.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-137 aligncenter" title="svn diff in colors" src="/uploads/wp/2009/06/svn-diff-after-400x183.png" alt="svn diff in colors" width="400" height="183" /></a></p>

In ubuntu it's as simple as running:
<pre>sudo aptitude install colordiff</pre>
Once doing that we should be able to redirect the output of commands like <em>diff</em> and <em>svn diff</em> to colordiff and view it in colors:
<pre>svn diff plugins/zMobyPicturePlugin/lib/zMobyPictureClient.class.php | colordiff</pre>
To improve it even more we can declare simple function in <em>~/.bashrc</em> file (using it requires re-login):
<pre>svndiff()
{
  svn diff "${@}" | colordiff
}</pre>
Function will make the command shorter:
<pre>svndiff plugins/zMobyPicturePlugin/lib/zMobyPictureClient.class.php</pre>
<strong>Note</strong>: You can achieve pretty much the same with vim. To learn about it read: "<a title="Viewing svn diff result in vim" href="/viewing-svn-diff-result-in-vim">Viewing svn diff result in vim</a>".
