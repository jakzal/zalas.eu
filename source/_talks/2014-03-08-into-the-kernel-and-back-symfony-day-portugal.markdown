A journey into the heart of the Symfony framework, explaining internals of the application and http kernels, including the rich event ecosystem.

Discover almost unlimited possibilities that come with the framework out of the box, and can be used to extend its default request handling.

Finally, learn how to leverage the kernel and the event dispatcher to migrate away from an Old School PHP Spaghetti Projectâ„¢ to a modern Symfony based application.
