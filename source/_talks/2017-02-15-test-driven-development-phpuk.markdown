Learn everything from writing good unit tests, through using test doubles (like stubs or mocks),
to writing integration tests. Learn how to structure your project to benefit from a test-first design.
Apply the right amount of testing on appropriate levels, write decoupled code,
and run your tests in seconds, not hours.
The result will look suspiciously close to the hexagonal architecture.
