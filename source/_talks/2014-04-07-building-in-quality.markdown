During the talk Jakub will remind about the importance of building the quality into an application from the very beginning. Agile methodologies are very popular these days. Writing user stories with acceptance criteria, standups and other agile ceremonies are nothing new to most of us. Going one step further and automating the acceptance criteria with tools like Cucumber, JBehave or Behat, improves the external quality of software, by focusing the development on the business goals. On the other hand, unit level tools aim to ensure the inner quality of code and support the developer, but seem to be totally worthless from the client’s perspective. Besides, how do we make sure that we’re building the right thing? How do we get satisfying acceptance criteria? How do we keep the business engaged?
