An agile developer wouldn't be really agile if they didn't welcome changes with open arms.
This requires a certain discipline and approach to writing code,
so it doesn't start to rot and smell of a bad design.

During the talk Jakub will remind you principles and techniques every developer claiming to be agile
should use on a daily basis. 
You'll learn how to write loosely coupled code, make it less rigid, less fragile, and more fun!
