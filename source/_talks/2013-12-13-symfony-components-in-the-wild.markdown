Symfony is a full-stack framework built on top of reusable components. Since those components are decoupled, theyâ€™re also successfully used with many open source projects, custom-built applications, other frameworks or even legacy applications needing an injection of up-to-date technology. The talk is an introduction to several Symfony components. It shows how easy it is to use them alone, integrated into a custom project and how components are used with existing open source applications.
