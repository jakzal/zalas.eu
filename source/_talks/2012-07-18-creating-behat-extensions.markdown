Recent refactoring of Behat makes it one of the most extendable testing frameworks. On our next meetup we'll have a closer look at the new extension system which made this possible.

We'll also try doing some live coding again. So if you have an idea for an extension, give us a shout and we might implement it during the meetup!

Last but not least there's gonna be time for open discussion to share your experience and learn from others.
