A journey into the heart of the Symfony framework,
explaining internals of the application and http kernels,
including the rich event ecosystem.
Discover almost unlimited possibilities that come with the framework out of the box,
and can be used to extend its default request handling.
Finally, §learn how to leverage the kernel and the event dispatcher to migrate away
from an Old School PHP Spaghetti Project™ to a modern Symfony based application. 

At the end of this workshop you will gather a better understanding of Symfony internals
and will be able to build on the core elements around the Symfony kernel,
to gently migrate out from legacy in the direction of a more maintainable project code base.
