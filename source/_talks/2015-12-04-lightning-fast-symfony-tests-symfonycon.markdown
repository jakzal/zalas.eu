One of the benefits of having an automated test suite is the feedback given when the code is being
changed. As a project grows, the test suite becomes slower and slower every day, until itâ€™s so slow it
stops being useful.

Learn how to structure your Symfony project to benefit from lightning fast tests. Apply the right amount
of testing on appropriate levels, and run your tests in seconds, not hours.
