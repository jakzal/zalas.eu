This workshop further explores topics covered by the
[Lightning fast tests](/talks/2016/lightning-fast-tests-dpc/) talk.
Learn how to structure your project to benefit from lightning fast tests
and get the testing pyramid right. Apply the right amount of testing
on appropriate levels, and run your tests in seconds, not hours.
