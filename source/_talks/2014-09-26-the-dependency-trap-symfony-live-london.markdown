A framework, by definition, provides a basic set of tools to use for
application development to avoid writing repeatable code.
It often encourages us to take shortcuts to enable rapid development.
In theory, we only need to implement the part which is specific to our domain.
In practice, we often end up with highly coupled code,
mixed layers and a dependency graph deceptively close to spaghetti.

This talk is going back to basics to remind you what software coupling is
and when to consider it good or bad.
The presentation will also demonstrate a few techniques on how to write
applications that embrace change in a Symfony environment.
