SpecBDD is the inner loop of Behavior Driven Development. Working on the code level, it's the Test Driven Development redefined.

PhpSpec, being a SpecBDD tool, aims on ensuring the internal quality of an application. It makes the test-first approach a lot easier by supporting the developer at every step, almost suggesting next actions to take. Its revolutionary approach makes that once you tried PhpSpec, there's no way back.

During the talk I introduced the attendees to PhpSpec and shown how to use it to drive the design and improve the quality of a Symfony application.
