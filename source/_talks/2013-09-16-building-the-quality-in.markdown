Agile methodologies are very popular these days. Writing user stories with acceptance criteria, standup meetings and other agile ceremonies are nothing new to the most of us.

Going one step further and automating the acceptance criteria with tools like Behat, improves the outer quality of the software we write, by focusing the development on the business goals from the very beginning.

On the other hand, tools like PhpSpec aim to ensure the inner quality of code, supporting the developer at every step by almost suggesting next actions to take.

During the talk Jakub presented development practices for developers focused on building quality into the application with a test-first approach.
