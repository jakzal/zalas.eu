One framework to rule them all! Symfony2 is a full stack web development framework and it will solve all your problems! Right? ...maybe. There's no solution that could perfectly work for all the projects. That's why it's important to have a good toolbox to choose from. Symfony is a framework but it might also become your missing toolbox. Symfony is a set of reusable and decoupled PHP components designed to solve common web development problems. While as a framework it might not be the best for some of your projects, you can always build on top of its solid foundation of well written, tested and flexible components. The talk makes an introduction to several Symfony components. It shows how easy it is to use them standalone or integrate in a custom project. Talk ends with an example of how you could combine components to build your own solutions.
