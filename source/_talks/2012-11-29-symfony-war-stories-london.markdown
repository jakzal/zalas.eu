Symfony2 has been around for a while now. Many of us already have a battlefield experience gained on many delivered projects.
Others are just starting to look into the framework and, since its adoption is only growing,
are interested in improving their Symfony-fu.

On our next meetup we'll share the lessons learned while working on Symfony2 projects.
Some things to be careful about, some good practices to follow, or not so good ones to avoid.
