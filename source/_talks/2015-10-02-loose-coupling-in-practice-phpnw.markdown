Practices like DDD are becoming so popular in the PHP world that we tend to forget about
the most basic forces in object oriented design - coupling and cohesion.

This tutorial will remind you how important loose coupling is,
what are the risks carried by tightly coupled software,
and how to write loosely coupled code in a context of frameworks and libraries.
