Today, 28th of July 2011, [Symfony 2 was announced stable](http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-2-0). We've been waiting long but it was worth it!

[Symfony community is pushing the PHP ecosystem](http://pooteeweet.org/blog/0/1915) for quite some time already. It sets the trends and standards not only by developing the framework but also by providing many **high quality tools** which can be used without it (like Behat, Assetic, Twig). Also, the whole idea of decoupled components brings **a new quality** to the **PHP** world.

Stable release of Symfony2 marks the begining of [a new era of PHP frameworks](http://blog.webspecies.co.uk/2011-05-23/the-new-era-of-php-frameworks.html).

Personally, at the beginning of 2007 I was about to abandon PHP and move to something else. Release of symfony 1.0 made me stay for quite long.

Today Symfony2 **brings the faith in PHP back** again. Thanks to all of [the contributors](http://symfony.com/contributors)!
