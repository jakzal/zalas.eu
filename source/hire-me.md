# Hire Me!

I'm an agile software engineer who helps organisations to deliver high quality
solutions.

Quality solutions that both solve a business problem and enable sustainable development.

## Consulting

I run my own consultancy business and I'm available to hire for both short term
engagements and long term projects.

I strongly believe in leading by example, which I think distinguishes me from other consultants.
Instead of just giving an advice and leaving, I like to become a part of the team and practice what I preach.


## Code reviews

To put my experience to a good use I often perform application reviews
and code quality analysis for clients who wish to have their code base looked at
by an independent company. Such reviews are made of detailed analysis of the code
base and practices, with recommendations on how they could be improved.

Apart from one off reviews I also offer my time on a monthly basis to perform
regular code reviews on your team's pull requests. This way I'm able to provide
constant feedback to your team and improve their skills over time. You decide how much
of my time a month you need.

## Training courses & workshops

I've got a huge experience with training delivery, both with standardised pre-defined
public courses to need-driven customised courses based on prior team assessment.
I'm particularly proud of training over hundred developers in a single organisation.
It required me to assess skills of the team and listen to their needs to finally prepare
and deliver a customised training.

I've got some off-the-shelf courses prepared, but I strongly believe in
customised training as it's more rewarding and valuable for both the student and the teacher.
Training courses I've delivered so far cover, but are not limited to, the topics below:

* Clean code
* Agile development practices
* Object Oriented Design, SOLID principles, loose coupling
* Symfony & PHP
* Test Driven Development
* Behaviour Driven Development
* Domain Driven Design
* Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment
* Tools: Symfony ecosystem, PHPUnit, PhpSpec, Behat, Docker
